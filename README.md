### [Rental Analysis](rental_analysis.ipynb)

For this section, these are following tasks:

- First, we will calculate the number of housing units per year in San Francisco, California and that will help users to visualize it.

- Second, we will determine the average housing costs per year and create a visualization chart to help users to visualize the property value as well as rent value over time.

- Third, We will plot interactive visualization of average prices over time for each neighborhood.

- Fourth, we will find the top 10 most expensive neighborhood by sorting mean sale price for each neighborhood.

- Fifth, we compare average price per square foot versus average monthly rent by year.

- Sixth, we will build an interactive map with the average prices per neighborhood and also create create a Parallel Coordinates plot, Parallel Categories plot, and a Sunburst plot so that investors can interactively filter and explore various factors related to the sales price of the neighborhoods.


### [Dashboard](dashboard.ipynb)
